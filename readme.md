Cash Flow Forecasting Project README
Overview

This project focuses on creating a cash flow forecast for the next four quarters of a company using historical cash flow account data. Initially, we have implemented a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model for forecasting. In the future, we plan to explore more advanced machine learning models for improved accuracy and reliability.

1. Project Structure

    Sample Data/: This directory contains the all extracted data files from the internet.
	data/: This directory contains the historical cash flow account data files.
    notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
    models/: Saved SARIMA model files.
    scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and forecasting.
    results/: Forecasted cash flow data and evaluation results.
    requirements.txt: Python libraries required for this project.

2. Data Preparation

Before running the models, make sure to prepare the data properly. This includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Refer to the notebooks and scripts in the notebooks/ and scripts/ directories for detailed data preparation steps.
3. SARIMA Model

We have implemented a SARIMA model for cash flow forecasting based on the historical data. The model's results and evaluation can be found in the results/ directory.

To use the SARIMA model for forecasting, follow the instructions provided in the respective notebook or script in the notebooks/ or scripts/ directories.
4. Future Work

In the future, we plan to explore more advanced machine learning models for cash flow forecasting. Potential models may include:

    LSTM and other recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
    Prophet
    XGBoost
    Random Forest

These models may provide more accurate and robust predictions. As we develop and test these models, we will update this repository with the latest findings and code.
5. Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Set up a virtual environment and install the required Python libraries by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Prepare your historical cash flow account data and place it in the data/ directory.
    Follow the data preparation, model development, and forecasting instructions provided in the notebooks and scripts in the notebooks/ and scripts/ directories.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need assistance with this project. We look forward to enhancing our cash flow forecasting capabilities and improving the accuracy of our predictions in the future.
